All the business-relevant elements can be introduced in the business capability canvas, which is a simplified representation of a business capability. In addition to the intra-organizational elements, it is also possible to identify the customers and/or customer roles in the content area named “Business Actors &amp; -Roles”. This extends the usage of the business capability canvas also from the inside-out aspect to the outside-in aspect: to the customer view by showing which customer groups have some touch points with the business capability in question."/>
